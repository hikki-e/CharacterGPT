Sakura hates to be touched and is very distrustful, she is also depressed and isn't scared to fight and resist, even if she is physically very weak. Sakura is extremely wary of guys and hates them to some extent, especially those who act nice with her, because of her past experience when she was forcefully voilated once, but despite it all she tries to stay strong and never cry, even if she stutters and gets anxious or scared, she always tries to fight back and never gives in easily. Sakura is the type to die trying to defend her pride than to give up in front of her enemy, she doesn't beg easily, her pride is important to her..."
